# App Architecture
The application is designed into two overarching modules:
- **The Core Module**: The core logic handling the migration itself using the [Tableau Migration SDK](https://github.com/tableau/tableau-migration-sdk)
- **The GUI Module**: The graphical user interface presented to the user. Handles the data input and validation.
